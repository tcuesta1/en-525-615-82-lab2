= EN.525.615 - Lab 2 Assignment

WARNING:  This is the first revision of this lab. There may be _some_ bugs.  Ask questions as needed in the `Lab 2 Discussion` area




== Lab Setup



=== Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment link

Now that you have a GitHub Account, you can accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment for this Lab.

The GitHub Classroom Assignment for this Lab can be found here: https://classroom.github.com/a/cCwpj1wL


=== Clone the Lab 2 Git Repository

This lab contains a minimum seed repository that is the same as the previous labs.
Clone the repository the same way that was done in the previously.

=== Development Environment Updates

Make sure to grab the updated QEMU binary from the Lab 2 Module in Blackboard and properly configure your debug configuration to use it.

TIP: See the <<QEMU_UPDATE_SECTION>> section for more details.


== Embedded Hello World

The most common 'Hello World' equivalent for an embedded system is blinking an LED.
In this section, we will work through setting up the project to target the NUCLEO-F103RB development board, update the code to blink and LED and run the application on the QEMU Emulator for the board.

=== Project Creation


* Click File-> New -> STM32 Project
* Click Board Selector
* In Commercial Part Number Enter `NUCLEO-F103RB`
* Click the Row for the `NUCLEO-F103RB` in the Board List area and then Click `Next`

image::images\lab2-b975e.png[]



* In the Project Name enter `hello_world`
* Click `Next`

image::images\lab2-5206a.png[]


* Ensure the latest Firmware is selected
** As of this writing the latest firmware is V1.8.1
* Click Finish

image::images\lab2-731ea.png[]


* Click `Yes` to initialize all peripherals with their default mode

image::images\lab2-2a9d7.png[]

* Click “Yes” to open the Device Configuration Tool perspective

image::images\lab2-d207a.png[]



Your STM32CubeIDE should now look similar to the image below.

image::images\lab2-a27ad.png[]

We are now going to change a few of the Project Code Generator settings.
We are going to change the generator so that it creates a pair of ‘.c/.h’ file per peripheral.
Without this change, the main.c file is overloaded with a lot of peripheral setup code.


* Click “Project Manager”
* Click “Code Generator”
* Check “Generate peripheral initialization as a pair of ‘.c/.h’ file per peripheral”

WARNING: There is an option for “Backup previously generated files when re-generating” - however it does not seem to work

Your screen should look similar to the image below.

image::images\lab2-be141.png[]

* Press `Ctrl-S` to save the configuration file (alternatively you can Click File->Save)
* Click `Yes` to generate the Code

image::images\lab2-d86e7.png[]

* Click `Yes` to enter the C/C++ perspective

image::images\lab2-5fed9.png[]


Your screen should now look similar to the image below.

image::images\lab2-aa276.png[]


==== Commit Your Code


This is a good place to commit your code.
It's all auto-generate code and by committing it now you can easily see what you might have changed/added compared to the auto-generate content.

TIP: Anytime you make a change using the Device Configuration Tool, we recommend you commit the changes.  This will make is easier to see your changes vs auto generated coded changes.


=== Hello World - Das Blinky!

==== Hardware and the HAL API

Looking at the NUCLEO-F103RB Schematic (Page 4) we see that GPIO Port A Pin 5 (PA5) is connected to the LED.
Writing a 1 to the

image::images\lab2-3e199.png[]



Since we also used the NUCLEO-F103RB Board Template and Initialized to the defaults STM32CubeIDE also defined `LD2 [Green LED]` on Pin PA5.  When you open the “hello_world.ioc” file with the Device Configuration Perspective you can see the pin labeled similar to the image below.


image::images\lab2-33677.png[]

The tool will also create the some helper definitions for you.  Open the “main.h” file and you will see the following lines.


image::images\lab2-28036.png[]


TIP: This is convenient however if you were to fully embrace this workflow then you would need to label every pin and I find it easier to manually create pin definitions.  This allows me to add comments about the pin definitions.  Either way is acceptable in this class.


We see `GPIO_PIN_5` and `GPIOA`, but what are they and where are those defined and what are they?

```
#define LD2_Pin GPIO_PIN_5
#define LD2_GPIO_Port GPIOA
```

Hold down ‘Ctrl’ and Left Click on `GPIO_PIN_5` and we see that it is a bit-mask with bit index 5 containing a `1` (ie, 0000000000100000b):

```
#define GPIO_PIN_5                 ((uint16_t)0x0020)  /* Pin 5 selected    */
```

Let us look closer at the `GPIOA` definition.

* Hold down ‘Ctrl’ and Left Click on `GPIOA`.

This should bring you to the `stm32f103xb.h` file and you should see the following:

image::images\lab2-d79ac.png[]



It looks like this device has five ports (A, B, C, D and E).  They are all pointers to a memory location (GPIOA_BASE, GPIOB_Base, etc) and are all of type `GPIO_TypeDef`.

```
#define GPIOA               ((GPIO_TypeDef *)GPIOA_BASE)
#define GPIOB               ((GPIO_TypeDef *)GPIOB_BASE)
#define GPIOC               ((GPIO_TypeDef *)GPIOC_BASE)
#define GPIOD               ((GPIO_TypeDef *)GPIOD_BASE)
#define GPIOE               ((GPIO_TypeDef *)GPIOE_BASE)
```

Looking around the same file, we can see all the addresses defined

```
#define PERIPH_BASE           0x40000000UL /*!< Peripheral base address in the alias region */
#define APB2PERIPH_BASE       (PERIPH_BASE + 0x00010000UL)
#define GPIOA_BASE            (APB2PERIPH_BASE + 0x00000800UL)
```

Therefore, it looks like GPIOA_BASE is located at 0x40010800UL (i.e. 0x40000000UL + 0x00010000UL + 0x00000800UL)
If you compare that to RM0008 Table 3, we see that this value does line up with the data sheet.

image::images\lab2-c12c5.png[]



In the same file, we can see the definition of GPIO_TypeDef.  We see that it is the register map of a General Purpose I/O Peripheral.

```
/**
  * @brief General Purpose I/O
  */

typedef struct
{
  __IO uint32_t CRL;
  __IO uint32_t CRH;
  __IO uint32_t IDR;
  __IO uint32_t ODR;
  __IO uint32_t BSRR;
  __IO uint32_t BRR;
  __IO uint32_t LCKR;
} GPIO_TypeDef;
```


Looking at `RM0008` Section 9.5 Table 59 “GPIO Register map and reset values”.
We can see that the `GPIO_TypeDef` structure represents the register map for the GPIO peripherals.
If we overlay this structure on top of the memory at the base address for the GPIO peripheral we can easily get to the correct offset of any register in the peripheral and read or write any of its control and status bits.
This is the core method for how the HAL drivers work. For each peripheral, HAL defines a structure to map the control/status registers so that they are easy to access by the low-level drivers.

image::images\lab2-cc8fc.png[]





From the “UM1850 Description of STM32F1 HAL and low-layer drivers” Section “20.2.4 IO operation functions” we see there is a `HAL_GPIO_WritePin` function.


TIP – STM32CubeIDE/Eclipse has a great Code Completion feature.  Type “HAL_” then press “Ctrl-Space” and a drop-down menu of known keywords available from the source code and API.  You can continue typing to get closer to what you are looking for.  Now continue typing so you have “HAL_GPIO” then you can use the Up/Down Arrows to select the desired word and press “Enter”

In the main while loop, enter ` HAL_GPIO_WritePin`

Ctrl Right Click on ‘HAL_GPIO_WritePin` and you will just to the function definition and see the the Doxygen formatted function comment found in the source code.
```
/**
  * @brief  Sets or clears the selected data port bit.
  *
  * @note   This function uses GPIOx_BSRR register to allow atomic read/modify
  *         accesses. In this way, there is no risk of an IRQ occurring between
  *         the read and the modify access.
  *
  * @param  GPIOx: where x can be (A..G depending on device used) to select the GPIO peripheral
  * @param  GPIO_Pin: specifies the port bit to be written.
  *          This parameter can be one of GPIO_PIN_x where x can be (0..15).
  * @param  PinState: specifies the value to be written to the selected bit.
  *          This parameter can be one of the GPIO_PinState enum values:
  *            @arg GPIO_PIN_RESET: to clear the port pin
  *            @arg GPIO_PIN_SET: to set the port pin
  * @retval None
  */
void HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIO_TypeDef *GPIOx, uint16_t GPIO_Pin, GPIO_PinState PinState)
```

From this, we see this function needs the GPIO_TypeDef Port and GPIO Pin arguments that we explored earlier.



Looking at the the “UM1850 Description of STM32F1 HAL and low-layer drivers” Section “6 HAL System Driver” we see there is a `HAL_Delay` function.
This function has an uint32_t argument for the minimum number of milliseconds to delay.  



==== Debugging and Running With QEMU

* Select Run->Debug Configurations...
* Double Click on `GDB QEMU Debugging`

image::images\lab2-1befc.png[]

You should now see a screen similar to the one below.

TIP: If `Project` is not filed in with `hello_world` then you didn't have the project selected when you launched the Debug Configuration menu.
You can Click `Browse...` to correct this.

TIP: If `C/C++ Application` is not filled in with `Debug\hello_world.elf`, then the project was not built when you launched the Debug Configuration menu.
You will need to exit the Debug Configuration area and build the project.  You can then click `Search Project...` to fine the executable `Debug\hello_world.elf`

image::images\lab2-f5964.png[]

* Click on the `Debugger` tab
* In the `Board name:` area enter `NUCLEO-F103RB`
* In the `Device name:` area enterh `STM32F103RB`

Your screen should look similar the image below.


image::images\lab2-3ca99.png[]

*Fixing the GDB Path Bug*

Look at the `Actual Executable` entry in the above image.
It is simply set to `gdb` instead of the full path and executable name.
This is because the `${cross_prefix}`` and `${cross_suffix}` eclipse environment variables do not exist.

* In `Executable name` enter `${gnu_tools_for_stm32_compiler_path}\arm-none-eabi-gdb`

This will tell STM32CubeIDE to use the GDB installed with the STM32CubeIDE.

TIP: When targeting the actual hardware and not QEMU this bug fix is not needed

Your screen should now look similar to the image below.
You can see that the `Actual executable` is filled in.

* Click `Debug` to run your application

image::images\lab2-dc338.png[]


TIP: If you do not specify the board name and device name and try to run it, you will get Console printout with a list of board and device names supported


If all goes well, you will see an image of the NUCLEO-F103RB board displayed.

image::images\lab2-a7a33.png[]

You will be prompted to switch to the Debug Perspective.

* Click `Switch`


image::images\lab2-c0a0e.png[]



You will now enter the Debug Perspective and the debugger will be suspended at the first instruction in main.

image::images\lab2-857f2.png[]


* Repeatedly click `F6` to step over the code
* After you execute the first `HAL_GPIO_WritePin` line go back to the NUCLEO-F103RB graphic window.

image::images\lab2-f8d86.png[]

* Press `F8` to resume the program
* Go back to the NUCLEO-F103RB graphic window - you should see the LED blinking


The program will continue in this infinite loop until you press `Ctrl-F2` (or the Stop Icon).



==== Commit Your Code


This is a good place to commit your code.




=== User Control of the LED


If this example we will use a Button connected to the GPIO Pin to control the LED.

In the same workspace, create a project named `user_input` and target the same `NUCLEO-F103RB` board used in the `Hello World - Das Blinky` section.


From the schematic, we can see the Blue Button (B1) is connected to Port C, Pin 13 (PC13).
There is a weak pull-up resistor connect on the GPIO Input side of the button and the other side is connected to ground.
This results in the GPIO Pin reading a logic '1' when the button is *not pressed* and a logic '0' when the button *is pressed*.

We can also see a RC filter across the button.  This should prevent bounce on the GPIO signal by filtering out the rapid mechanical movements of the switch contacts until they settle.

TIP: A common design pattern to handle button de-bounce in software is to monitor it over a small period and detect when it has become stable after some time.  The same logic can be used to determine between a long or short press on a button.  See the optional de-bounce article in the Module 3 reading.


image::images\lab2-8be55.png[]


Looking at the `main.h` file we can see they made some definitions that we can use.

```
#define B1_Pin GPIO_PIN_13
#define B1_GPIO_Port GPIOC
```



From the “UM1850 Description of STM32F1 HAL and low-layer drivers” Section “20.2.4 IO operation functions” we see there is a `HAL_GPIO_ReadPin` function.


TIP: Remember you can type `HAL_GPIO_` and press `Ctrl-Space` add see all of the functions associated with the HAL GPIO Driver and then Ctrl-LeftClick to jump to their function definitions to better understand now to use them.

We can see the `HAL_GPIO_ReadPin` has similar arguments as the `HAL_GPIO_WritePin`
```
/**
  * @brief  Reads the specified input port pin.
  * @param  GPIOx: where x can be (A..G depending on device used) to select the GPIO peripheral
  * @param  GPIO_Pin: specifies the port bit to read.
  *         This parameter can be GPIO_PIN_x where x can be (0..15).
  * @retval The input port pin value.
  */
GPIO_PinState HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIO_TypeDef *GPIOx, uint16_t GPIO_Pin)
```

* Use `HAL_GPIO_ReadPin` and `HAL_GPIO_WritePin` to turn *ON* the LED when the Button is *PRESSED*

TIP: There is a bug in the QEMU model that defaults the Button to logic '0' on startup.  After you pressed the button once, it will behave properly.


== Traffic Light Intersection System


In this section, you will create a system that implements the following state machine.


image::images\lab2-d21f1.png[]


You will use the QEMU Board Model `NUCLEO-F103RB-TRAFFIC`.

WARNING: Be sure to enter `NUCLEO-F103RB-TRAFFIC` in the debug configuration menu

This model connects GPIO ports to virtual LEDs and Sensors (Buttons) that are overlaid on a Traffic Light Intersection image.

image::images\lab2-c684e.png[]

[[QEMU_UPDATE_SECTION, QEMU Update]]
=== QEMU Update

In the Lab 2 Module on Blackboard, under the `QEMU ARM Update` section,  you will find an updated QEMU-ARM Package with the `NUCLEO-F103RB-TRAFFIC` model that is required for this lab.

* Download the version for the operating system you are using
* Extract the archive to a convenient location


TIP: You can follow the manual install process describe https://xpack.github.io/qemu-arm/install/#manual-install[HERE] if you want to follow the xPack QEMU Arm conventions


When you run/debug the application, you will need to tell STM32CubeIDE to use the updated QEMU application.

* In the Debug Configurations, Debugger Tab
** Click `Browse` in the `Executable path` area
** Locate `<extraction path>\bin\qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse`
*** Note the extension will vary based on OS

|===


=== Project Setup

* In the same workspace create a new project called `traffic_light_fsm`
* Target the same NUCLEO-F103RB Board
* Follow the same procedures as in the previous sections

==== Enable FreeRTOS Middleware


The QEMU model of our board does not implements timers so we will use FreeRTOS and their software timers for this.



* In the Device Configuration Perspective we need to enable FreeRTOS and some features
** Click `Middleware`
** Click `FreeRTOS`
** Change `Interface` from `Disabled` to `CMSIS_V2`
** Click on the `Timers and Semaphores` tab


image::images\lab2-49b24.png[]


** Click `Add` in the `Timers Area` and
** Press `Ok`


image::images\lab2-93b58.png[]



** Add a second timer, but this time make it a `osTimerOnce`
** Press `Ok`

image::images\lab2-32108.png[]

You should now have a Device Configuration similar to the image below.

image::images\lab2-16bf9.png[]

* Press `Ctrl-S` to save this configuration


You will be prompted with this warning

image::images\lab2-df5a1.png[]

Due to the fact that the QEMU doesn't model any timers beyond Systick, we are forced to proceed.
This is not a real system, so we will be ok.

* Click `Yes`


==== QEMU FreeRTOS Port Bug fix

There is a bug in the QEMU model that is related to how FreeRTOS verifies it understands the hardware it is running on.

Navigate to the `xPortStartScheduler` function in the `port.c` file.

This is located `/traffic_light_fsm/Middlewares/Third_Party/FreeRTOS/Source/portable/GCC/ARM_CM3/port.c`

TIP: You can enter `xPortStartScheduler` in one of your projects source files and Ctrl-LeftClick on the function to jump to it!

Around like 290 you will see a line with `ulMaxPRIGROUPValue = portMAX_PRIGROUP_BITS;`

Disable the checks immediately after that line by adding the `#if 0 / #endif` blocks as seen below.
Then save the file.

```
/* Calculate the maximum acceptable priority group value for the number
of bits read back. */
ulMaxPRIGROUPValue = portMAX_PRIGROUP_BITS;
#if 0
while( ( ucMaxPriorityValue & portTOP_BIT_OF_BYTE ) == portTOP_BIT_OF_BYTE )
{
  ulMaxPRIGROUPValue--;
  ucMaxPriorityValue <<= ( uint8_t ) 0x01;
}
#ifdef __NVIC_PRIO_BITS
{
  /* Check the CMSIS configuration that defines the number of
  priority bits matches the number of priority bits actually queried
  from the hardware. */
  configASSERT( ( portMAX_PRIGROUP_BITS - ulMaxPRIGROUPValue ) == __NVIC_PRIO_BITS );
}
#endif
#ifdef configPRIO_BITS
{
  /* Check the FreeRTOS configuration that defines the number of
  priority bits matches the number of priority bits actually queried
  from the hardware. */
  configASSERT( ( portMAX_PRIGROUP_BITS - ulMaxPRIGROUPValue ) == configPRIO_BITS );
}
#endif
#endif
```

WARNING: This procedure needs to be done each time the Device Configuration Tool is run.  Alternatively you can edit/replace the port.c file in the STM32CubeIDE installation directory to work around this.


==== Add More GPIO

We will now programmatically add some more GPIO Pins.
We will add the North Bound Leds.
Since the GPIO_PIN_X is a bit mask and this set of LEDs is on the same port, we can initialize them all at once.

* Open the `main.h`
* Locate the `/* USER CODE BEGIN Private defines */` section
* Update it with the following contents

```
/* USER CODE BEGIN Private defines */

#define LD_NB_RED_GPIO_Port    (GPIOB)
#define LD_NB_YELLOW_GPIO_Port (GPIOB)
#define LD_NB_GREEN_GPIO_Port  (GPIOB)
#define LD_NB_GPIO_Port        (GPIOB) //these are all on the same port - lets make a common def

#define LD_NB_RED_Pin          (GPIO_PIN_0)
#define LD_NB_YELLOW_Pin       (GPIO_PIN_1)
#define LD_NB_GREEN_Pin        (GPIO_PIN_2)

/* USER CODE END Private defines */
```


* Open the `gpio.h`
* Locate the `/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */` and `/* USER CODE BEGIN Prototypes */` sections
* Update it with the following contents

```
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
#include "main.h"
/* USER CODE END Includes */
```

```
/* USER CODE BEGIN Prototypes */
void CUSTOM_GPIO_Init(void);
/* USER CODE END Prototypes */
```


* Open the `gpio.c`
* Locate the `/* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */` section
* Update it with the following contents


```
/* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */
void CUSTOM_GPIO_Init()
{
    //Init NB LED's
    GPIO_InitTypeDef GPIO_InitStruct = {0};

    /* GPIO Ports Clock Enable */
    __HAL_RCC_GPIOB_CLK_ENABLE();

    /*Configure GPIO pin Output Level */
    HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LD_NB_GPIO_Port, LD_NB_RED_Pin|LD_NB_YELLOW_Pin|LD_NB_GREEN_Pin, GPIO_PIN_RESET);

    /*Configure GPIO pin : PtPin */
    GPIO_InitStruct.Pin = LD_NB_RED_Pin|LD_NB_YELLOW_Pin|LD_NB_GREEN_Pin;
    GPIO_InitStruct.Mode = GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_PP;
    GPIO_InitStruct.Pull = GPIO_NOPULL;
    GPIO_InitStruct.Speed = GPIO_SPEED_FREQ_LOW;
    HAL_GPIO_Init(LD_NB_GPIO_Port, &GPIO_InitStruct);

}
/* USER CODE END 1 */
```

* Open the `main.c`
* Locate the `* USER CODE BEGIN 2 *` section
* Update it with the following contents
```
    /* Initialize all configured peripherals */
    MX_GPIO_Init();
    MX_USART2_UART_Init();
    /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
    CUSTOM_GPIO_Init();
    /* USER CODE END 2 */
```

==== A new main loop


Our main function looks a bit different now.
Notice the comment that we should never make it to the main infinite loop.
That is because `osKernelStart` should never return.


```
/* Init scheduler */
osKernelInitialize();  /* Call init function for freertos objects (in freertos.c) */
MX_FREERTOS_Init();
/* Start scheduler */
osKernelStart();

/* We should never get here as control is now taken by the scheduler */
/* Infinite loop */
/* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
while (1)
{
  /* USER CODE END WHILE */

  /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
}
/* USER CODE END 3 */
```


Open up `freertos.c` and you will see the `StartDefaultTask` functions.


```
/**
  * @brief  Function implementing the defaultTask thread.
  * @param  argument: Not used
  * @retval None
  */
/* USER CODE END Header_StartDefaultTask */
void StartDefaultTask(void *argument)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN StartDefaultTask */
  /* Infinite loop */
  for(;;)
  {
    osDelay(1);
  }
  /* USER CODE END StartDefaultTask */
}

```


There is nothing specific about the name of this function and FreeRTOS.
If you look at the `Tasks and Queues` tab in the FreeRTOS area of the Device Configuration Tool you will see the tool defaulted to one initial task.
You can change the parameters and name of this task.
You can also add more tasks, similar to how we added multiple timers.

image::images\lab2-53c5d.png[]


==== Starting the software timer

Open up `freertos.c` and you will see the `mySystemTimerCallback` the software timer callback we defined earlier.


Every time our  `mySystemTimer` software timer expires, `mySystemTimerCallback` will get called.

Likewise, every time out `myOneShotTimer` software timer expires, `myOneShotTimerCallback` will get called.

```
/* mySystemTimerCallback function */
void mySystemTimerCallback(void *argument)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN mySystemTimerCallback */

  /* USER CODE END mySystemTimerCallback */
}
```

Let us do a simple update to toggle a few LEDs every time the `mySystemTimerCallback` function is called.

```
/* mySystemTimerCallback function */
void mySystemTimerCallback(void *argument)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN mySystemTimerCallback */
  HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LD2_GPIO_Port,  LD2_Pin);
  HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LD_NB_GPIO_Port,  LD_NB_RED_Pin | LD_NB_YELLOW_Pin );

  /* USER CODE END mySystemTimerCallback */
}
```

If you were to set a breakpoint in this function and run the code, we would never see a breakpoint trigger.
The reason is that we never actually started the timer!

Let us start the timers by updating the `StartDefaultTask` function.

```
/**
  * @brief  Function implementing the defaultTask thread.
  * @param  argument: Not used
  * @retval None
  */
/* USER CODE END Header_StartDefaultTask */
void StartDefaultTask(void *argument)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN StartDefaultTask */

  osTimerStart(mySystemTimerHandle, 1000);   //TICK_RATE_HZ is 1000, so 1000 ticks is a second
  osTimerStart(myOneShotTimerHandle, 10000); //TICK_RATE_HZ is 1000, so 10000 ticks is 10 seconds

  /* Infinite loop */
  for(;;)
  {
    osDelay(1);
  }
  /* USER CODE END StartDefaultTask */
}
```


Since we define the `mySystemTimer` to as `osTimerPeriodic` it will automatically reload until we tell the OS to stop it.

Let update our `myOneShotTimerCallback` to stop the periodic timer, turn off the toggling LEDs and turn on another LED.

```
/* myOneShotTimerCallback function */
void myOneShotTimerCallback(void *argument)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN myOneShotTimerCallback */
  osTimerStop(mySystemTimerHandle);
  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LD_NB_GPIO_Port,  LD_NB_RED_Pin | LD_NB_YELLOW_Pin, GPIO_PIN_RESET );
  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LD_NB_GPIO_Port,  LD_NB_GREEN_Pin, GPIO_PIN_SET );
  /* USER CODE END myOneShotTimerCallback */
}
```

When you run this, the North Bound Red and Yellow LEDs will toggle for about 10 seconds at 1Hz.
After 10 seconds the One Time timer will expire and it's callback will run.
We then turn off the periodic timer and light up and led.


You can also set flags and queues to pass information around.
In this example we are essentially one thread running on one processor so messaging passing is easy.
When we have multiple threads then we will need to look into queues, mutex and semaphores to safely exchange data.


=== Build your system!

Now that we have a good amount of the infrastructure in place, you should now implement the system using the Finite State Machine transition diagram above.
You do not need to define your State Machine logic the way described in the reference material, they are just provided as a possible example.
